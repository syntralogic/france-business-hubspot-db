# France Business & Artisan Database for HubSpot CRM

Pipeline that builds a deduplicated, enriched database of French businesses and artisans
(SIRENE-based) and exports a HubSpot-ready CSV. No website or frontend: data in, CSV out.

## Status
Built incrementally, one commit per step. See docs/ for the blueprint.

## Planned stack
- PostgreSQL (central store), Python 3.11+ (ETL, matching, enrichment)
- Weekly scheduled run (cron or systemd timer)
- Primary source: INSEE SIRENE (bulk files + API); enrichment from authorized providers only

## Layout
- docs/ : blueprint documents (requirements, sources, schema, mapping, costs)
- sql/ : PostgreSQL DDL
- src/fbdb/ : extract, transform, match, enrich, load, export
- config/ : settings templates (no secrets)
- tests/ : unit and integration tests
- data/ and reports/ : local outputs (git-ignored)

## Principles
- Never fabricate contact data; every field carries source, date and status.
- SIREN = legal company, SIRET = establishment.
- Secrets only via environment variables (.env, never committed).
